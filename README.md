### Open API spec
go-swagger brings to the go community a complete suite of fully-featured, high-performance, API components to work with a Swagger API: server, client and data model.
* How to generate go client libraries?
    Assumptions:
    a.	Running Windows
    b.	Using Powershell
    c.	Directory for source code: C:\devel\

    1.	Install Golang
    2.	Install go-swagger.exe, add to $PATH
        ```
        go get -u github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/cmd/swagger
        ```
    3.	Create the following directories:
        ```
        C:\devel\datalake-test\src\
        ```
    4.	Copy “search_openapi.json” to “C:\devel\datalake-test\src”
    5.	Set environment variable GOPATH (run the following in Powershell):
        ```
        $env:GOPATH="C:\devel\datalake-test\"
        ```
    6.	Change current directory to “C:\devel\datalake-test\src”
        ```
        cd C:\devel\datalake-test\src
        ```
    7.	Run the following command:
        ```
        swagger generate client -f 'search_openapi.json' -A search_openapi
        ``` 

### Maintenance
* Indexer:
  * Cleanup indexes - Indexer has a cron job running which hits following url:
  ```
  /_ah/cron/indexcleanup
  ```
  Note: The job will run for all the tenants in a deployment. It will delete all the indices following the pattern as:
  ```
    <accountid>indexpattern
  ```
  where indexpattern is the index pattern regular expression which you want to delete
  indexpattern is defined in web.xml (in indexer) file with an environment variable as CRON_INDEX_CLEANUP_PATTERN
  The scheduling of cron is done in the following repository:
